# Salvador Villalon Personal Website
[FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Certification] - Project: Personal Website
- A Web Application that shows who I am and the work I have done

# Summary 
- Two years ago when I was a Sophomore at UC Irvine, I told myself that one day I was going to create my own personal website. Then, during Fall 2017
I started taking FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate and one of the projects was to create your own Personal Website. I decided to really embrace this project.

- It was until Summer 2018 were I finally created a functional Personal Website.

- I initially started with HTML and CSS, but after learning about Flask. I decided to use it on my website and it made the logic behind the 
code easier to understand. Also, since I used Flask this meant that I had to deploy to a cloud service like Google App Engine. GitHub Pages is meant
static pages.

# Next Steps
- The next steps for my website will be to learn how to use JavaScript to make it more dynamic

# Technology
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Google App Engine
- Python 
- Flask
